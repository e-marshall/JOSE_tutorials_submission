# to do

## getting started
- change links to tutorials in getting_started to be in text not heading
- add learning objectives 
- add images for pangeo, xarray, pythia...
- maybe other resources could be a section on this page?

## context + motivation
- tighten writing
- add figures?
- add references, see paper

## anatoomy of a data cube
- need to think about how to do this. like deepak's suggestion of using an example, need to figure out where/ how to introduce it in relation to the tutorial data

## tutorials overview
- prob some of whats in here is redundant with other sections

## data used in this tutorial
- maybe useful to have a page/section that is an intro/background on each dataset? 
- maybe this could segue into each dataset in an Xarray context? 
- currrently each tutorial has this, maybe move them to a central page/section and link to it
