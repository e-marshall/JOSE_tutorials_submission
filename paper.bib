This new way of thinking has encouraged the pursuit of new discoveries. Big data occupies the strategic high ground in the era of knowledge economies and also constitutes a new national and global strategic resource. “Big Earth data”, derived from, but not limited to, Earth observation has macro-level capabilities that enable rapid and accurate monitoring of the Earth, and is becoming a new frontier contributing to the advancement of Earth science and significant scientific discoveries. Within the context of the development of big data, this paper analyzes the characteristics of scientific big data and recognizes its great potential for development, particularly with regard to the role that big Earth data can play in promoting the development of Earth science. On this basis, the paper outlines the Big Earth Data Science Engineering Project (CASEarth) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Strategic Priority Research Program. Big data is at the forefront of the integration of geoscience, information science, and space science and technology, and it is expected that big Earth data will provide new prospects for the development of Earth science.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The core tools of science (data, software, and computers) are undergoing a rapid and historic evolution, changing what questions scientists ask and how they find answers. Earth science data are being transformed into new formats optimized for cloud storage that enable rapid analysis of multi‐petabyte data sets. Data sets are moving from archive centers to vast cloud data storage, adjacent to massive server farms. Open source cloud‐based data science platforms, accessed through a web‐browser window, are enabling advanced, collaborative, interdisciplinary science to be performed wherever scientists can connect to the internet. Specialized software and hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence are being integrated into data science platforms, making them more accessible to average scientists. Increasing amounts of data and computational power in the cloud are unlocking new approaches for data‐driven discovery. For the first time, it is truly feasible for scientists to bring their analysis to data in the cloud without specialized cloud computing knowledge. This shift in paradigm has the potential to lower the threshold for entry, expand the science community, and increase opportunities for collaboration while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility. Yet, we have all witnessed promising new tools which seem harmless and beneficial at the outset become damaging or limiting. What do we need to consider as this new way of doing science is evolving?
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            For a long time, scientists have downloaded data and analyzed it on their computer. This made collaborating hard because other people did not have access to the same data, software, and computer. It also gave scientists at big institutions with fast internet and lots of computers an advantage. Now, data are being put on the cloud, scientists are sharing their software, and anyone can access a computer on the cloud through their web browser. This makes it easier to collaborate because everyone can access the same data, software, and computer. Also, more people can access powerful computers and do science. This is a different way of doing science and there are potential drawbacks. We need to be careful that this new way of doing science actually advances science and includes more people so that we get better answers, faster.

A key challenge is to align the current state of how users access, process and analyse the data with trends and roadmaps large data organisations layout. In addition, due to the increased availability of open data, a more diverse user base wants to take advantage of Earth science data leading to new user requirements. We run a web-based survey among Big Earth data users to better understand the motivation to migrate to cloud-based services as well as the challenges and opportunities that might arise. Results show an overall interest in moving to cloud-based services but air an insuﬃcient literacy in cloud systems and a lack of trust due to security concerns and opacity of emerging costs. These gaps demand eﬀorts on three levels. First, cloud services shall be targeted at intermediate users instead of policy- and decision-makers and over-engineered systems with a high level of abstraction should be avoided. Second, more substantial capacity-building eﬀorts are required to decrease the existing gap in cloud skills and uptake. Third, a cloud certiﬁcation mechanism could help in building up overall trust in cloud-based services.},

The purpose of this study was to provide a review of the most important global open data remote sensing satellite missions, current state-of-the-art processing methods and applications in land monitoring and conservation studies. Multispectral (Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS), radar (Sentinel-1), and digital elevation model missions (SRTM, ASTER) were analyzed, as the most often used global open data satellite missions, according to the number of scientiﬁc research articles published in Web of Science database. Processing methods of these missions’ data consisting of image preprocessing, spectral indices, image classiﬁcation methods, and modelling of terrain topographic parameters were analyzed and demonstrated. Possibilities of their application in land cover, land suitability, vegetation monitoring, and natural disaster management were evaluated, having high potential in broad use worldwide. Availability of free and complementary satellite missions, as well as the open-source software, ensures the basis of eﬀective and sustainable land use management, with the prerequisite of the more extensive knowledge and expertise gathering at a global scale.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) has made signiﬁcant contributions to conservation and ecology; however, direct use of RS-based information for conservation decision making is currently very limited. In this paper, we discuss the reasons and challenges associated with using RS technology by conservationists and suggest how training in RS for conservationists can be improved. We present the results from a survey organized by the Conservation Remote Sensing Network to understand the RS expertise and training needs of various categories of professionals involved in conservation research and implementation. The results of the survey highlight the main gaps and priorities in the current RS data and technology among conservation practitioners from academia, institutions, NGOs and industry. We suggest training to be focused around conservation questions that can be addressed using RS-derived information rather than training pure RS methods which are beyond the interest of conservation practitioners. We highlight the importance of developing essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) and how this can be achieved by increasing the RS capacity of the conservation community. Moreover, we suggest that open-source software is adopted more widely in the training modules to facilitate access to RS data and products in developing countries, and that online platforms providing mapping tools should also be more widely distributed. We believe that improved RS capacity among conservation scientists will be essential to improve conservation efforts on the ground and will make the conservation community a key player in the deﬁnition of future RS-based products that serve conservation and ecological needs.},

Decolo­ nizing climate needs to address the complexities of colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, international development, and geopolitics that contribute to the reproduction of ongoing colonialities through existing global governance structures, discursive framings, imagined solutions, and interventions. This requires addressing both epistemic violences and material outcomes. By weaving through such mediations, I offer an understanding of climate coloniality that is theorized and grounded in lived experiences.},

The IPCC assessment also results in the separation of the Earth, Biological and Social sciences. The integration that occurs is mainly between closely related scientific fields. The research community consequently imposes a physical and economic bias and a separation of scientific fields that the IPCC reproduces in the policy sphere. It is argued that this physical and economic bias distorts a comprehensive understanding of climate change and that the weak integration of scientific fields hinders climate change from being fully addressed as an integral environmental and social problem. If climate change is to be understood, evaluated and responded to in its fullness, the IPCC must broaden its knowledge base and challenge the anthropocentric worldview that places humans outside of nature.},
