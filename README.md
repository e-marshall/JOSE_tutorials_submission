# About

This repository is a submission to the Journal for Open Source Education (JOSE) of two Jupyter book tutorials developed by Emma Marshall, Jessica Scheick, Scott Henderson and Deepak Cherian. They were developed in 2022 during a project which began while Emma Marshall was an intern at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the SIParCS program and the co-authors were her internship mentors. 

The repositories for each indivdual tutorial are located here: [ITS_LIVE tutorial repo](https://github.com/e-marshall/itslive), [Sentinel-1 RTC tutorial repo](https://github.com/e-marshall/sentinel1_rtc)
